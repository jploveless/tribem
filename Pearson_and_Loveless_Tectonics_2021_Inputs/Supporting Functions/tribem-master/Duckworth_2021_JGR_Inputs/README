2021, Slip and strain accumulation along the Sadie Creek fault, Olympic Peninsula, 
Washington: Journal of Geophysical Research, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JB020276

1. Download tribem package from https://github.com/jploveless/tribem
2. Load the Matlab file "BEM_inputs.mat" into the Matlab workspace
3. Run the command:

>> [slip, trac] = tribemx(p, d, bc);

4. Visualize fault slip using "meshview.m" function. For example, to plot dip slip 
rates, run:

>> meshview(p.c, p.v, slip(:, 2));
